// Problem Description
// You have a set of N jobs, each job has a deadline and a profit associated with it. You earn the profit for a job only if you complete it within its deadline. Each job takes 1 unit of time to complete and only one job can be scheduled at a time.

// Your task is to find the maximum profit that you can earn by selecting and scheduling the jobs optimally.

// Input format
// The first line contains an integer N, denoting the number of jobs in the set.

// The second and third lines contain N integers each, denoting the deadline for each job and the profit associated with it, respectively.

// Output format
// Return a single integer - the maximum profit that can be earned.

// Sample Input 1
// 4

// 4 1 1 1

// 20 10 40 30

// Sample Output 1
// 60

// Explanation
// Maximum profit is achieved by performing jobs 1 and 3 (20 + 40 = 60).

// Sample Input 2
// 5

// 2 1 1 2 1

// 100 19 25 27 15

// Sample Output 2
// 127

// Explanation
// Maximum profit is achieved by performing jobs 1 and 4 (100 + 27 = 127).

// Constraints
// 1 <= N <= 100000

// 1 <= deadline[i] <= 100

// 1 <= profit[i] <= 500
