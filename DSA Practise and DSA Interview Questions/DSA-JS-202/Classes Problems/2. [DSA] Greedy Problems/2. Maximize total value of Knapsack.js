// Problem Description
// Given weights and values of N items, we have to put these items in a knapsack of capacity W in such a way that maximum capacity is used.

// Note: It is allowed to break items for maximizing the total value of knapsack, i.e., it is not necessary to take the whole item.

// Input format
// The first line contains 2 integers, N and W denoting the number of items and the capacity of the knapsack.

// The second line contains N integers, with the i-th one representing the weight of the i-th item.

// The third line again contains N integers, with the i-th number representing the value of the i-th item.

// Output format
// Print a double value representing the maximum value that can be obtained with the given knapsack capacity.

// The output would be considered correct upto 6 digits of precision.

// Sample Input 1
// 3 4

// 2 2 3

// 100 10 120

// Sample Output 1
// 180.00

// Explanation
// Total maximum value of item we can have is 180.00 for the given capacity of sack by taking the whole of item 1 and (2/3)rd of item 3.

// Constraints
// 1 <= N <= 100000

// 1 <= W <= 100000

// 1 <= weights[i] <= 200000

// 1 <= values[i] <= 1000000000

// Note: It is recommended to use double instead of float to store values in C++ submissions.
